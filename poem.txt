A comforting black looms over the ground
It stands mysteriously with it great stars wound
Holding unknown materials abound 
Planets galore with creatures unfound
Perhaps ones with fins now icebound
Or ones with sentience who've never been aboveground
And worlds with no creatures  sound.
Forever expanding with a limitless bound
